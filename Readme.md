# Chores

## Features

- [X] recurring chores
- [ ] recurring chores with a specific weekday (or range) (plan food for the week on weekdends)
- [X] snoozing of chores (what's the difference between snoozing and just leaving overdue? snoozing is a way to say
  "I'm not going to do this today, but I will do it tomorrow")
- [ ] one off chores (when completed they are shown as completed on the day of completion then hidden, so it's possible
  to uncomplete them)
  - keep them crossed of during the completion day then remove them
